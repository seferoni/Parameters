# Overview

Parameters' primary function is to expand game difficulty configuration, primarily with the aim of providing finer control over economic and strategic-layer variables. It also provides certain auxiliary functions that likewise make minor changes to game systems, all of which are entirely optional. In its current state (v1.0.0), Parameters does the following:
- Expands upon and exposes internal game variables, including item cost & rarity, recruit rarity, repair & healing rates, XP rates, loot scarcity, enemy scaling, etc.
- Fixes and re-implements certain game systems, including permitting discovered beasts to despawn (whereas they are prohibited from doing so in vanilla, thereby bottlenecking spawns), and restoring the ability to manually remove items from the player stash.
- Provides a simple & optional alternative to acquiring the Reproach of the Old Gods which safely bypasses and disables all instances of the Kraken encounter (and all Kraken spawns broadly). Requires Beasts & Exploration.
